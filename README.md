# CSV-Combiner

The user must include a form of input for the code to properly work, an example of the format is provided below:


def main():
    
    file_location = "C:/Users/Name/Documents/Data"
    
    csv_combine(file_location)


if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()


Alternatively, you can use an altered version of the program in which the user only inputs the directory

Program Example: 

Enter Csv file location: C:/Users/Name/Documents/Data
